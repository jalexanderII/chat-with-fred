# TAkehome Frontend Template

Our app's frontend uses Vite + React + shadcn / tailwindcss, but you may use anything you'd like for this exercise. This template is provided for your convenience, so feel free to discard it if you would prefer something else.

### Using

- Run the server: `pnpm run dev`
- Edit: `src/App.tsx`
